# It is used to regularly cycle (or rotate) log files by removing the oldest ones from your system and creating new log files.
# The logrotate program is configured by entering options in the /etc/logrotate.conf file.
# logrotate.conf tells logrotate to be read in the log rotation parameters, which are stored in the files contained in the /etc/logrotate.d directory.

# solr log rotate file will be getting cerated under /etc/logrotate.d
